# Todo-Enhancement

Observations and Learnings:

1. React Component: The code defines a React component ToDoList responsible for managing a todo list.

2. State Management: It uses React's useState hook to manage state for todo items and input value.

3. User Input Handling: Functions like handleValue and handleAddValue handle user input changes and addition of new todo items.

4. State Update: Functions like handleComplete and handleRemove update the state based on user actions like marking a task as complete or removing it.

5. Rendering Logic: JSX is used to render the todo list dynamically, with checkboxes for completion status and buttons for removal.

6. CSS Styling: CSS styles are applied to layout elements, buttons, and table for better presentation.

Overall, the code demonstrates fundamental concepts of React such as state management, event handling, JSX rendering, and CSS styling.
